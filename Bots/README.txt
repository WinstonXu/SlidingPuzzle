Create various bots using different search algorithms to solve a sliding puzzle game on a nxn board.

Algorithms used: Depth first search, breadth first search, iterative depth first search, and A* search.

All the algorithms work on 2x2 boards. Breadth first and A* reliably work on 3x3 boards. Depth first and iterative depth first can only work on 3x3 boards if the starting board is set up in a way that the first path they go down has the solution.
